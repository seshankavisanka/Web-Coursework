                1–3km (0.6–1.9 miles) , half-day to one day , moderate
                
                Okay, it’s not a trek in the classic sense, but there’s plenty of tramping required to gain the summit of Sri Lanka’s most famous lookout, crowned by the ruins of King Kasyapa’s palace. To reach the evocative sprawl of ruins on top of this imposing granite outcrop, you'll need to climb nearly 1200 steps. The reward for all this exertion is a view over an endless sweep of Sri Lankan countryside extending to the horizon in all directions – just watch out for the bothersome wasps on the way up!
                
                For views with more privacy, walk for about a kilometer (0.6 miles) to reach the 5th-century monastic complex at Pidurangula, crowning another rocky outcrop to the north of Sigiriya. It’s a half-hour clamber past ancient Buddhist temples and carvings to the summit, which looks out over a carpet of forest with the mighty mass of Sigiriya rising like a stone exclamation mark in the middle of the vista. Come with your own transport and you can add on a slender loris-spotting night walk with the resident naturalist at the Jetwing Vil Uyana hotel near Kimbissa.</p>

                4.5km to 10km (3 to 6 miles), half-day, easy
                
                Ella is the hiking hub of the hills, and pretty much every guest house in town can provide a map of the tracks and trails that wind between the ridges to tea estates, waterfalls and viewpoints. It’s easy to fill several days wandering to lookouts and posing for pics (or watching Instagrammers do the posing) beside the landmark Nine Arches Bridge. Staying in a guesthouse also means a fabulous, home-cooked meal at the end of a day of walking.
                
                Start your explorations with the 4.5km (3 mile) round-trip to Little Adam’s Peak – a green knoll with great views of waterfalls and tea factories shimmering out of the mist that cloaks the surrounding hills. The 10km (6 mile) walk to Ella Rock is more demanding, but also more rewarding; a sustained climb through classic highland country, starting right on the railway tracks at Ella Station. A final ascent through eucalyptus forests will drop you on top of a rocky outcrop with dizzying views over the hill country (and mobs of resident monkeys waiting to relieve you of any snacks you brought along for the journey).

                9.5km (6 miles), three hours, easy
                World’s End is the apt nickname for the sheer drop-off at the edge of the Horton Plains,
                 which looks out over one of Sri Lanka's most jaw-dropping vistas. When we say "plains",
                  we actually mean an undulating plateau over 2000m (6560ft) high, covered by wild grasslands,
                   rocky outcrops,
                 filigree waterfalls, misty lakes, and patches of thick forest teeming with birdlife.
                Horton Plains National Park is one of the few reserves where visitors can walk unaccompanied,
                 but there’s no public transport, so you’ll need to arrange a drop-off and pick-up in Nuwara Eliya or Ohiya.
                  After a 4km (2.5 mile) hike across the plateau, the terrain drops away without warning at World’s End. 
                  The views of the lowlands floating below are awesome when the weather is clear, but come early 
                  in the morning to beat the crowds and the clouds. The trail loops back to pretty Baker’s Falls
                   before returning to the national park entrance at Far Inn, so you’ll need about three hours to 
                   complete the 9.5km (6 mile) round trip.
