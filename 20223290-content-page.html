              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sri Lanka was ruled by Kings from
              ancient times as far back as the 3rd century B.C spanning over
              2.500 years as recorded history depicts. Recent excavations show
              that even during the Neolithic Age, there were food gatherers and
              rice cultivators in Sri Lanka. Very little is known of this
              period; documented history began with the arrival of the Aryans
              from North India. The Aryans introduced the use of iron and an
              advanced form of agriculture and irrigation. They also introduced
              the art of government. Of the Aryan settlements, Anuradhapura grew
              into a powerful kingdom under the rule of king Pandukabhaya.
              According to traditional history he is accepted as the founder of
              Anuradhapura.<br /><br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the reign of King Devanampiya
              Tissa, a descendent of Pandukabhaya, Buddh√≠sm was introduced in
              247 B.C. by Arahat Mahinda, son of Emperor Asoka of India. This
              can be seen as one of the milestones in the history of Sri Lanka.
              When the new civilisation blossomed, Sri Lanka became a culturally
              high ranking and well founded state. In the mid 2nd

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century B.C. a large part of north
              Sri Lanka came under the rule of an invader from South India. From
              the beginning of the Christian era and up to the end of the 4th
              century A.D. Sri Lanka was governed by an unbroken dynasty called
              Lambakarna, which paid great attention to the development of
              irrigation. A great king of this dynasty, Mahasen (3rd century
              A.D.) started the construction of large `tanks' or irrigation
              reservoirs. Another great `tank' builder was Dhatusena, who was
              put to death by his son Kasyapa who made Sigiriya a royal city
              with his fortress capital on he summit of the rock.

              century A.D. Vijayabahu 1 repulsed the invaders and established
              his capital at Polonnaruwa in the 11th century A.D. Other great
              kings of Polonnaruwa were Parakrama Bahu the Great and Nissanka
              Malla both of whom adorned the city with numerous buildings of
              architectural beauty.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invasion was intermittent and the
              capital was moved constantly until the Portuguese arrived in 1505,
              when the chief city was established at Kotte, in the western
              lowlands. The Portuguese came to trade in spices but stayed to
              rule until 1656 in the coastal regions, as did the Dutch
              thereafter. Dutch rule lasted from 1656 to 1796, in which year
              they were displaced by the British. During this period the
              highland Kingdom, with its capital in Kandy, retained its
              independence despite repeated assaults by foreign powers who ruled
              the rest of the country. In 1815 the kingdom of Kandy was ceded to
              the British and thus they established their rule over the whole
              island.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British colony, called Ceylon,
              gained independence in 1948. The newly independent nation retained
              the name Ceylon until the 1972 constitution renamed it Sri Lanka.
              Since independence Sri Lanka has maintained a democratic,
              multi-party system of government. Modern communications, western
              medical services, education in English, as well as the plantation
              industry (first coffee then tea, rubber and coconut) developed
              during British rule.By a process of peaceful, constitutional
              evolution, Sri Lanka won back her independence in 1948 and is now
              a sovereign republic, with membership in the Commonwealth of
              Nations and the United Nations Organization. A civil war erupted
              in 1983 between the government forces and Tamil separatists
              movements in the North-East. In February 2002, after nearly two
              decades, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the government
              and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE), the major Tamil
              separatist movement who, after signing the agreement, renounced
              the claim for a separate state and agreed to settle for a federal
              solution. Due to regular violations of the ceasefire by the Tamil
              Tigers and the apparent unwillingness of the Tigers to find a
              solution of the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka, the government
              cancelled the ceasefire agreement in 2008 and started its
              humanitarian operation for the liberation of the North and East
              from the terrorism of the Tamil Tigers, which was concluded in May
              of 2009. Since then, reconstruction and reconciliation on the
              island is under way.
